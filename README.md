# Secret-Santa-Application-
This small project was inspired by a group of friends who asked me to create an application that would assign each person a secret Santa. For those who are unaware of what secret Santa is, to put briefly, names are put into a hat. A person will then remove a piece of paper from the hat at random. They will then open that piece of paper in private.  Written on that piece of paper is someones. The person will then obligated to give the put they have been assigned to a gift. 

Using the collections framework and ArrayLists I created an application that allowed me to assigned someone a secret santa at random. This was my apporached. This project involved two ArrayLists. ArrayList one contains Person objects who are participating in secret santa. ArrayList two holds the same Person objects that are Arraylist one, but randomized. All objects in ArrayList one are then assigned a secret santa from ArrayList two at random.
